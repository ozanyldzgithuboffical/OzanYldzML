# Machine Learning Repo

1 **Machine Learning (ML)** is defined as the use algorithms and computational statistics to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It is a subsection of the artificial intelligence domain within computer science.
- The ML repository contains the following sections:
  1. **Data Analysis**
   -Source of Data
   -Data Types
   -Missing Values
   -Data Frames
   -Feature Scaling (Normalization & Standardization)
  2. **Prediction**
   -Simple Linear Regression
   -Multiple Linear Regression
   -Polynomial Regression
   -Support Vector Regression
   -Decision Tree Regression
   -Random Forest Regression (Ensemble Algorithm Logic)
  3. **Prediction Evaluation Metrics**
   -R-Square
   -Average R-Square
   -Comparison of Prediction Algorithms
  4. **Classification**
   - Classification Overview
   - Types of Classification Methods
   - Logistic Regression Classifier
   - K-NN Classifier
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
   - Kernel Trick for SVM
   - Naive Bayes Classifier
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Tuning on K-NN,SVM,Random Forest Classifiers
   - Evaluation Metrics for Classification Algorithms **(Specificity,Recall(Sensivity,True Positive Rate),ROC Area,AUC Area)**
  5. **Clustring**
  - Overview of Clustring
  - K-Means Algorithm

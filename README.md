- **Machine Learning (ML)** is defined as the use algorithms and computational statistics to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It is a subsection of the artificial intelligence domain within computer science.

## Support Vector Regression
- Support Vector Machine can also be used as a regression method, maintaining all the main features that characterize the algorithm (maximal margin).
- The Support Vector Regression (SVR) uses the same principles as the SVM for classification, with only a few minor differences.As the name suggest the SVR is an regression algorithm , so we can use SVR for working with continuous Values instead of Classification which is SVM. 

## Terms of Algorithm
- **Kernel:** The function used to map a lower dimensional data into a higher dimensional data.There are different kernel options.Default is linear.You can use also **rbf (Radial Basis Function)**,**Gaussian**,**Polynomial** etc.
- **Hyper Plane:** In SVM this is basically the separation line between the data classes. Although in SVR we are going to define it as the line that will will help us predict the continuous value or target value
- **Boundary Line:** In SVM there are two lines other than Hyper Plane which creates a margin . The support vectors can be on the Boundary lines or outside it. This boundary line separates the two classes. In SVR the concept is same.
- **Support Vectors:** This are the data points which are closest to the boundary. The distance of the points is minimum or least.

## Kernel Trick (Mercer's Theorem)
- In some cases plotting and classifying the data points in 2d-space.
- The **kernel trick** involves taking a dataset that possible involves a curved space and embedding it in a higher-dimensional space to **"flatten"** it out, as many machine learning methods struggle with curved manifolds.

## Implementation Phase
- We first split our test and train data.Then we fit the model over X to Y.
- Than,we predict over our test data set and compare with the actual y (class) values 

- **Example Code**
```python
#verilerin olceklenmesi
svc_classificator=SVC(kernel='poly')
svc_classificator.fit(x_train,y_train)
svc_predict=svc_classificator.predict(x_test)

svc2_classificator=SVC(kernel='rbf')
svc2_classificator.fit(x_train,y_train)
svc2_predict=svc2_classificator.predict(x_test)

#we give predicted and test
cm=confusion_matrix(y_test,svc_predict)
cm2=confusion_matrix(y_test,svc2_predict)

print('Confusion Matrix Polynomial:')
print(cm)

print('Confusion Matrix RBF:')
print(cm2)


```

## Data Frame Concatanation
- Data frames are the any part of the data set.We sometimes need to make some preprocessing on the specific features.
- After the process,the dataframes should be concataned to be used as a model in learning process.
- To concatanate the data frames Pandas library used.
- **Example Code:**
```python
    #Create Data Frame for country
    countryDataFrame=pd.DataFrame(data=country,index=range(22),columns=['tr','fr','us'])
    #print(countryDataFrame)

    #Create numerical data frame
    numericalDataFrame=pd.DataFrame(data=numericalData,index=range(22),columns=['length','weight','age'])
    #print(numericalDataFrame)

    #concat two data frame I do not add the gender since it is the descriptor field of model
    ultimateDataFrame=pd.concat([countryDataFrame,numericalDataFrame],axis=1)
    print(ultimateDataFrame)
```

## Data Frame Extraction
- In machine learning we work on datasets.These datasets consists of features that we extract.
- In some cases we could not find any feature or an input that is about un-supervised learning topic.
- These datasets are also a data frame themselves and we can take a small part of them.For instance we can use some part of the data
for model learning as independent variables and some others for dependent variables to predicted.
- Pandas library helps us to extract data frames.

## Source of Data

- It can be any unprocessed fact, value, text, sound or picture that is not being interpreted and analyzed. 
- Data is the most important part of all Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence. Without data, we canâ€™t train any model and all modern research and automation will go vain. 
- Big Enterprises are spending loads of money just to gather as much certain data as possible.
- Data can be sourced from anywhere such as via sensors,human actions,emotions etc.The most important thing is to understand the data and extracting knowledge with different kinds of methods.

## Data Types

- There are two major data types categorical & numerical data types respectively.
- Some machine learning algorithms do not work with nominal data types.We can need an encoding to provide an understanding for the algorithm.For instance think about the cities in your country.There are n cities and in some way we need to create an indicator for those to extract the feature.
- Categorical data types are divided into two major groups, nominal & ordinal data types.
- Ordinal data types can be sorted but not measured such as plate numbers.
- Nominal data types neither measured nor ordered.
- To convert the nominal and ordinal data types into measurable data types we can use some methods like Label Encoding,One-Hot Encoding.
- Numerical data types are divided into two major group: rational and interval data types.Values of these data types can be continuous like temperature sensor values etc.

## Missing Values
1. Sometimes our dataset can consist of missing values.In such conditions there are some methods to eliminate this factor.These are called **Imputation Methods**.Let's tell about some of them
- **Listweise Deletion**
 * Only data having missing records deleted simply.
- **Pairweise Deletion**
 * Only data entry deleted which has mising value on any feature/variable/column
- **Regression Imputation**
 * Missing value marked is copied with the older entry
- **Sthocastic Imputation**
 * A statistical distribution obtained over a data set and this distribution is used as a connection to fill the missing value record.

## Data Frames
- Data Frames are the part of data set.You can make a partition,take some entries of the data set.
- Pandas library is used to create data frames.

## Feature Scaling
- Sometimes our data set features values can be unproportional in terms of their lower and upper bound values or mean values.Plus,such machine learning algorithms have weakness for such cases,for instance **support vector machine (SVM)** . There are two known methods to tune the record values of different features to make the prediction in a healthy way.
-Every data set does not require normalization only for the data sets with which features have different range.
1.**Normalization**
-Normalization is a technique often applied as part of data preparation for machine learning. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values.
- z=(x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x) where x is the value of the data set record.
- Drawback of the normalization is,if there is a very big value in data set,then other datas can be reduced to 0 except the normalized data becomes 1.Because of this sometimes normalization can lead to lose the data in feature.

2. **Standardization**
Standardization looks for the deviation from the mean value without losing the value importance.

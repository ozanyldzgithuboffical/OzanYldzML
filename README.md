1 **Machine Learning (ML)** is defined as the use algorithms and computational statistics to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It is a subsection of the artificial intelligence domain within computer science.

## Multi-Armed Bandit Problem
- Multi-armed Bandit is synonymous to a slot machine with many arms. Each action selection is like a play of one of the slot machine’s levers, and the rewards are the payoffs for hitting the jackpot. Through repeated action selections you are to maximize your winnings by concentrating your actions on the best levers. Each machine provides a different reward from a probability distribution over mean reward specific to the machine. Without knowing these probabilities, the gambler has to maximize the sum of reward earned through a sequence of arms pull. If you maintain estimates of the action values, then at any time step there is at least one action whose estimated value is greatest. We call this a greedy action. The analogy to this problem can be advertisement displayed whenever the user visits a webpage. Arms are ads displayed to the users each time they connect to a web page. Each time a user connects to the page makes around. At each round, we choose one ad to display to the user. At each round n, ad i gives reward ri(n) ε {0, 1}: ri(n)=1 if the user clicked on the ad i, 0 if the user didn’t. The goal of the algorithm will be to maximize the reward. Another analogy is that of a doctor choosing between experimental treatments for a series of seriously ill patients. Each action selection is a treatment selection, and each reward is the survival or well-being of the patient.

## One-Hot-Encoding
- Categorical data are commonplace in many Data Science and Machine Learning problems but are usually more challenging to deal with than numerical data.
-One of the most common ways to make this transformation is to **one-hot encode** the categorical features, especially when there does not exist a natural ordering between the categories (e.g. a feature ‘City’ with names of cities such as ‘London’, ‘Lisbon’, ‘Berlin’, etc.). For each unique value of a feature (say, ‘London’) one column is created (say, ‘City_London’) where the value is 1 if for that instance the original feature takes that value and 0 otherwise.

- For instance you have a dataset and a country column/feature which has to many countries.You can convert this nominal feature into numerical form that machine learning algorithm can understand.
----Country----
- **Turkey =>>>>>1 0 0**
- **Germany =>>>>>0 1 0**
- **Holland =>>>>>0 0 1**

- **Example Code**
```python
 #label encoding object is instantiated
labelEncoding=LabelEncoder()

#first we get country data values
country=data.iloc[:,0:1].values
#print(country)
country[:,0]=labelEncoding.fit_transform(country[:,0])

#instance of OneHotEncoding
oneHotEncoding=OneHotEncoder()

country=oneHotEncoding.fit_transform(country).toarray()
print(country)
```


## Data Frame Concatanation
- Data frames are the any part of the data set.We sometimes need to make some preprocessing on the specific features.
- After the process,the dataframes should be concataned to be used as a model in learning process.
- To concatanate the data frames Pandas library used.
- **Example Code:**
```python
    #Create Data Frame for country
    countryDataFrame=pd.DataFrame(data=country,index=range(22),columns=['tr','fr','us'])
    #print(countryDataFrame)

    #Create numerical data frame
    numericalDataFrame=pd.DataFrame(data=numericalData,index=range(22),columns=['length','weight','age'])
    #print(numericalDataFrame)

    #concat two data frame I do not add the gender since it is the descriptor field of model
    ultimateDataFrame=pd.concat([countryDataFrame,numericalDataFrame],axis=1)
    print(ultimateDataFrame)
```

## Data Frame Extraction
- In machine learning we work on datasets.These datasets consists of features that we extract.
- In some cases we could not find any feature or an input that is about un-supervised learning topic.
- These datasets are also a data frame themselves and we can take a small part of them.For instance we can use some part of the data
for model learning as independent variables and some others for dependent variables to predicted.
- Pandas library helps us to extract data frames.

## Source of Data

- It can be any unprocessed fact, value, text, sound or picture that is not being interpreted and analyzed. 
- Data is the most important part of all Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence. Without data, we can’t train any model and all modern research and automation will go vain. 
- Big Enterprises are spending loads of money just to gather as much certain data as possible.
- Data can be sourced from anywhere such as via sensors,human actions,emotions etc.The most important thing is to understand the data and extracting knowledge with different kinds of methods.

## Data Types

- There are two major data types categorical & numerical data types respectively.
- Some machine learning algorithms do not work with nominal data types.We can need an encoding to provide an understanding for the algorithm.For instance think about the cities in your country.There are n cities and in some way we need to create an indicator for those to extract the feature.
- Categorical data types are divided into two major groups, nominal & ordinal data types.
- Ordinal data types can be sorted but not measured such as plate numbers.
- Nominal data types neither measured nor ordered.
- To convert the nominal and ordinal data types into measurable data types we can use some methods like Label Encoding,One-Hot Encoding.
- Numerical data types are divided into two major group: rational and interval data types.Values of these data types can be continuous like temperature sensor values etc.

## Missing Values
1. Sometimes our dataset can consist of missing values.In such conditions there are some methods to eliminate this factor.These are called **Imputation Methods**.Let's tell about some of them
- **Listweise Deletion**
 * Only data having missing records deleted simply.
- **Pairweise Deletion**
 * Only data entry deleted which has mising value on any feature/variable/column
- **Regression Imputation**
 * Missing value marked is copied with the older entry
- **Sthocastic Imputation**
 * A statistical distribution obtained over a data set and this distribution is used as a connection to fill the missing value record.

## Data Frames
- Data Frames are the part of data set.You can make a partition,take some entries of the data set.
- Pandas library is used to create data frames.

## Feature Scaling
- Sometimes our data set features values can be unproportional in terms of their lower and upper bound values or mean values.Plus,such machine learning algorithms have weakness for such cases,for instance **support vector machine (SVM)** . There are two known methods to tune the record values of different features to make the prediction in a healthy way.
-Every data set does not require normalization only for the data sets with which features have different range.
1.**Normalization**
-Normalization is a technique often applied as part of data preparation for machine learning. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values.
- z=(x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x) where x is the value of the data set record.
- Drawback of the normalization is,if there is a very big value in data set,then other datas can be reduced to 0 except the normalized data becomes 1.Because of this sometimes normalization can lead to lose the data in feature.

2. **Standardization**
Standardization looks for the deviation from the mean value without losing the value importance.

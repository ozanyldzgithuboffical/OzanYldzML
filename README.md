1 **Machine Learning (ML)** is defined as the use algorithms and computational statistics to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It is a subsection of the artificial intelligence domain within computer science.

## Source of Data

- It can be any unprocessed fact, value, text, sound or picture that is not being interpreted and analyzed. 
- Data is the most important part of all Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence. Without data, we canâ€™t train any model and all modern research and automation will go vain. 
- Big Enterprises are spending loads of money just to gather as much certain data as possible.
- Data can be sourced from anywhere such as via sensors,human actions,emotions etc.The most important thing is to understand the data and extracting knowledge with different kinds of methods.

## Data Types

- There are two major data types categorical & numerical data types respectively.
- Some machine learning algorithms do not work with nominal data types.We can need an encoding to provide an understanding for the algorithm.For instance think about the cities in your country.There are n cities and in some way we need to create an indicator for those to extract the feature.
- Categorical data types are divided into two major groups, nominal & ordinal data types.
- Ordinal data types can be sorted but not measured such as plate numbers.
- Nominal data types neither measured nor ordered.
- To convert the nominal and ordinal data types into measurable data types we can use some methods like Label Encoding,One-Hot Encoding.
- Numerical data types are divided into two major group: rational and interval data types.Values of these data types can be continuous like temperature sensor values etc.

## Missing Values
1. Sometimes our dataset can consist of missing values.In such conditions there are some methods to eliminate this factor.These are called **Imputation Methods**.Let's tell about some of them
- **Listweise Deletion**
 * Only data having missing records deleted simply.
- **Pairweise Deletion**
 * Only data entry deleted which has mising value on any feature/variable/column
- **Regression Imputation**
 * Missing value marked is copied with the older entry
- **Sthocastic Imputation**
 * A statistical distribution obtained over a data set and this distribution is used as a connection to fill the missing value record.

## Data Frames
- Data Frames are the part of data set.You can make a partition,take some entries of the data set.
- Pandas library is used to create data frames.

## Feature Scaling
- Sometimes our data set features values can be unproportional

@Controller
public class FormController {
//to-do smth
}
```
- @RequestMapping annotation is used to handle requests.Return value is the name of the jsp file declared in view resolver in servlet.xml

```java
@RequestMapping("/")
	public String showDefaultForm() {
		return "main-menu";
	}
```
## About the Project
- It basically takes an input from the form.The training aim is to reach the correct controller's method.
